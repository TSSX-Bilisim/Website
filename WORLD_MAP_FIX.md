# World Map Production Fix

## Issue Description

The world map in the References section was not working in production mode due to incorrect asset paths. The main issues were:

1. **World Map JSON Path**: The code was trying to fetch `/src/assets/world-110m.json` which doesn't exist in production builds
2. **Logo Paths**: Meta tags and favicon were using `/src/assets/logo.png` which also doesn't work in production
3. **Asset Handling**: Vite processes and moves assets during build, so direct `/src/assets/` paths are invalid in production

## Root Cause

In Vite development mode, assets in `/src/assets/` are served directly, but in production builds:
- Assets are processed, optimized, and moved to `/dist/assets/` with hashed filenames
- Only files in the `public/` directory are served directly from the root path
- The `/src/assets/` path structure doesn't exist in the built application

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Created Public Directory and Moved Assets
```bash
mkdir -p public
cp src/assets/world-110m.json public/
cp src/assets/logo.png public/
```

### 2. Fixed World Map Data Loading
**Before:**
```javascript
fetch("/src/assets/world-110m.json")
```

**After:**
```javascript
fetch("/world-110m.json")
```

### 3. Fixed Meta Tags in App.tsx
**Before:**
```html
<meta property="og:image" content="/src/assets/logo.png" />
<meta property="twitter:image" content="/src/assets/logo.png" />
```

**After:**
```html
<meta property="og:image" content="/logo.png" />
<meta property="twitter:image" content="/logo.png" />
```

### 4. Fixed Favicon in index.html
**Before:**
```html
<link rel="icon" href="/src/assets/logo.png" />
```

**After:**
```html
<link rel="icon" href="/logo.png" />
```

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling
Added proper HTTP status checking for the world map data fetch:

```javascript
fetch("/world-110m.json")
  .then((response) => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    return response.json();
  })
```

## Verification

1. ✅ Build completes successfully: `npm run build`
2. ✅ Assets are copied to dist folder: `world-110m.json` and `logo.png` present in `/dist/`
3. ✅ No TypeScript errors
4. ✅ Proper error handling in place

## Best Practices for Asset Handling in Vite

### For Static Assets (Large files, direct access needed):
- Place in `public/` directory
- Reference with absolute paths from root: `/filename.ext`
- Files are copied as-is to dist folder

### For Processed Assets (Images, fonts, smaller files):
- Keep in `src/assets/`
- Import as modules: `import logoUrl from './assets/logo.png'`
- Vite will optimize and hash the filenames

### Example of Module Import Approach:
```javascript
// Alternative approach for smaller assets
import worldMapData from './assets/world-110m.json'
import logoUrl from './assets/logo.png'

// Use directly without fetch
const countries = topojson.feature(worldMapData, worldMapData.objects.countries)

// Use in meta tags
<meta property="og:image" content={logoUrl} />
```

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Consider CDN**: For large files like world map data, consider using a CDN
2. **Lazy Loading**: Load the world map data only when the References section is visible
3. **Fallback UI**: The current error handling shows a fallback message, which is good practice
4. **Caching**: Consider adding cache headers for the world map JSON file
5. **Compression**: The 105KB JSON file could benefit from gzip compression

## Testing in Production

To test the production build locally:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Then navigate to the References section to verify the world map loads correctly.
